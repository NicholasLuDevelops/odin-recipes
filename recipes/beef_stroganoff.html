    <div class="instructions">
      <p>Instructions bc ya dumb:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Cut the beef into one-inch cubes and pat completely dry. Discard any
          large pieces of fat. Fat that’s marbleized into the meat is fine!
        </li>
        <li>
          Season with garlic salt and pepper. Sprinkle with flour and toss to
          coat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat 2 Tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Sear
          the meat in batches for 45 seconds per side, until browned but not
          cooked through. Use kitchen tongs to carefully remove and set aside on
          a plate. Add more olive oil between batches as needed and decrease
          heat slightly if the pan gets too hot.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add 1 Tablespoon butter and white wine to the pot over medium heat.
          Use a silicone spatula to “clean” (deglaze) the bottom of the pan. Add
          the onions and mushrooms and cook for 4 minutes. Add the minced garlic
          and cook for 1 more minute. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the beef broth, bouillon, red wine vinegar, Worcestershire sauce,
          and Dijon mustard to the Slow Cooker and stir to combine. Add the beef
          as well as any juice that may have dripped onto the plate. Add the
          onions/mushrooms/garlic.
        </li>
        <li>Cook on high for 4-5 or on low for 8-9 hours.</li>
        <li>
          Combine the cornstarch/cold water mixture and whisk it into the Slow
          Cooker.
        </li>
        <li>Flip to warm.</li>
        <li>
          In a medium bowl, whisk sour cream with 1 cup liquid from the slow
          cooker until smooth. Add to Slow Cooker and stir carefully to combine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in the condensed cream of mushroom soup if desired. (My homemade
          version adds even more thickness and flavor.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, turn heat off and swirl in 2 Tablespoons of cold butter. This
          adds a smooth, velvety finish.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve over egg noodles. If desired, add cooked/drained egg noodles
          right to the Slow Cooker, stir to combine, and serve!
        </li>
      </ol>
