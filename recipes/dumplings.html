    <p>
      Homemade dumplings that my parents make. I wrote this recipe down a while
      back in like 2020. Anyways it's relatively simple to make unless you're
      one of those people who can burn water but then that's a whole nother
      problem lol... Although the wrapping part of the dumpling takes a bit to
      get use to.
