    <p>
      Homemade dumplings that my parents make. I wrote this recipe down a while
      back in like 2020. Anyways it's relatively simple to make unless you're
      one of those people who can burn water but then that's a whole nother
      problem lol... Although the wrapping part of the dumpling takes a bit to
      get use to. The recipe will make about 100 dumplings.

      <li>2 tablespoons Salt</li>
      <li>.5 Cup Sesame Oil</li>
      <li>1 Cup Cooking Oil</li>
      <li>
        2 teaspoons White/Black Pepper (white pepper is better flavor imo)
      </li>
      <li>Water from the cabbage</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If adding seafood ex: Shrimp, Scallop -> Add another .5 lbs or more</p>

    <p>Dough:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups Flour</li>
      <li>1.25 cups Water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Flour:Water = 2:1 ratio</p>

    <p>To make the dough:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine Flour & Salt</li>
      <li>Slowly add water while kneading dough</li>
      <li>
        Knead until smooth then set aside (cover the dough. We usually just use
        a bowl and put it upside down)
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The rest of it:</h2>
    <p>Filling:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Finely chop cabbage
        <ul>
          <li>Add salt and cabbage in a big bowl</li>
          <li>Let sit and allow water to come out</li>
          <li>squeeze cabbage to get as much water out possible</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Mince garlic, fine chop chive and green onion</li>
      <li>
        Stir meat, ginger, pepper, sesame oil, cooking oil, cabbage water
        together in ONE-DIRECTION
        <ul>
          <li>
            so pick either clockwise or counter-clockwise and stick with it.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour veggies/seafood into the mix and then mix everything together
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Dough (part 2):</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make sure to coat the working surface with a generous amount of flour so
        the dough doesn't stick to the surface
      </li>
      <li>Take dough out of cover and knead until springy</li>
      <li>Take a chunk of dough and roll it into a long-ish/thin-ish log</li>
      <li>Cut log into small-ish chunks</li>
      <li>
        Roll out the dough with a rolling pin until thin and round. (Don't be
        too thin bc then it breaks easy)
      </li>
      <li>Place filling in center of of dough</li>
      <li>
        Squish the edges together. Find a video if you don't know how to do it.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Making it unraw:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring pot of water to a boil</li>
        <li>Gently toss dumplings in</li>
        <li>Bring water to boil again</li>
        <li>Add .5 cups water to pot</li>
        <li>Bring water to boil again</li>
        <li>Repeat 2 more times</li>
        <li>When the dumplings float on the surface of the water then it's ready</li>
    </ol>
